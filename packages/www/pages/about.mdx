# About

Developed in 2019 by the [nxtedition](https://nxtedition.com) team, **Caspar Graphics** originated as a solution for our internal challenges in creating graphics for clients. It's now a tool we believe could be beneficial for anyone working with HTML graphics in [CasparCG](http://casparcg.com/). We're eager to share it with the community.
