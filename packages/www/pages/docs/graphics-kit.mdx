# Graphics Kit 

A toolkit for building CasparCG graphics using React. It provides an abstraction on top of CasparCG's `play`, `stop` and `update` commands, turning them
into `state` and `data`. It also includes building blocks for common use cases such as:

- Animating with Framer Motion and GSAP
- Fetching data from external APIs
- Using RSS Feeds
- Display crawling text 
- Showing the current time
- Calling CasparCG's `remove()` function after animating out
- Loading external fonts while avoiding [FOUT](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/fout)
- And more...
