# GsapTimeline 

A component that makes it easier to use a [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) `timeline` for animations.

## Reference

```js
  <GsapTimeline
    hide={!text}
    onPlay={timeline => {
      timeline.from('#text', { y: 50, opacity: 0 })
    }}
    onStop={timeline => {
      timeline.to('#text', { y: 50, opacity: 0 })
    }}
  >
    <div id="text">
      {text}
    </div>
  </GsapTimeline>
```

### Props

- `hide`: A boolean that can be used to hide the graphic when certain conditions aren't met. 
- `onPlay` An [`onPlay`](/docs/gsap-timeline#onplay-callback) callback. It fires after the graphic has received `play` and any blocking resources has been loaded. It receives a [GSAP timeline](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline) that will be played as soon as your function ends. 
- `onStop` An [`onStop`](/docs/gsap-timeline#onplay-callback) callback. It fires after the graphic has received `stop`.

## `onPlay` callback

This callback will be called when the graphic has received the `play` command, and any blocking 
resources has been loaded. Nothing will be visible until this happens. When your function ends, 
the timeline will be played from start to finish.

### Parameters
- `timeline`: A [GSAP Timeline](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline) that will be played from start to finish.

## `onStop` callback

This callback will be called when the graphic has received the `stop` command. Once it has ended, `safeToRemove` will be called automatically. 

### Parameters
- `timeline`: The same [GSAP Timeline](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline) that was received in [`onPlay`](/docs/gsap-timeline#onplay-callback).
