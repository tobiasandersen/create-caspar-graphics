# Introduction

Caspar Graphics is a tool for building, testing and packaging HTML graphics for
[CasparCG](http://casparcg.com/) using code. It also includes building blocks for some common
use cases.

## Why Caspar Graphics?

We created Caspar Graphics to make it easier for ourselves to build and maintain graphic packages. It offers
a number of key benefits for people looking to create graphics efficiently and effectively:

**Scaffolding a new project** is super fast and you'll be up and running in just a matter of seconds. 

**A simple and intuitive UI** makes it easy to interact with your graphics â€” send data updates,
play and stop animations, and view all of your graphics together to make sure they're positioned properly.

**No configuration is needed** with out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS and more.

**Lightning Fast HMR** (Hot Module Replacement) enables you to quickly see your changes as they're
made.

**Connect to a CasparCG server** to easily test your graphics in a production environment. 

**Package your graphics** into an optimized bundle, ready to be played in CasparCG.


We've built Caspar Graphics on top of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which offers fast and reliable
performance with no need for configuration. This means that you can benefit from most of those
features as well.
