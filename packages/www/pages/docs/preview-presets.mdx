# Preview Presets

When you're building a graphic, it can be tedious having to send the same data updates all over again
every time you want to test or change something. To make this easier, you can set up sets of preview
data in your graphic's `manifest.json`.

Let's create two preview sets, each containing the two fields `name` and `title` :

```json filename="manifest.json" {13-22}
{
  "name": "Lowerthird",
  "schema": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "label": "Name"
    },
    "title": {
      "type": "string",
      "label": "Title"
    }
  },
  "previewData": {
    "Thierry Henry": {
      "name": "Thierry Henry",
      "title": "King of Highbury"
    },
    "Bukayo Saka": {
      "name": "Bukayo Saka",
      "title": "King of Emirates"
    }
  }
}
```

In the sidebar, you'll now have a new tab called "Presets" where you'll find the presets you just
created. Clicking one of the presets will send an update to the template containing all of its
fields. This can be very useful to quickly test different variations of the graphic.
