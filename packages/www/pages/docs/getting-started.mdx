# Getting Started


## Setup

First, let’s make sure that your development environment is ready.

- If you don’t have Node.js installed, install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). You’ll need Node.js version 18 or later.
- You’ll be using your own text editor and terminal app.


## Create a new project

To scaffold a new project, run any of the following three commands and answer the command prompt questions:

### npm

```bash
npm create caspar-graphics@latest
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn create caspar-graphics
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm create caspar-graphics@latest
```

--- 

After your project has been created, you'll have a folder containing:

```
.
└── templates
    └── example
        └── index.html
        └── manifest.json
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
```

The `templates` folder contains all your graphic templates. Each subfolder that contains an 
`index.html` file and a `manifest.json` will be picked up as a graphic, with the html file as its entry point. 

*An `example` graphic has been created for you that you can either delete or rename to your liking.*

 
## Run the development server

Once the installation is done, follow the on-screen instructions by moving into your project folder and running:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev  
```


This will install the dependencies and start the development server and its accompanying UI. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it inside the browser:
