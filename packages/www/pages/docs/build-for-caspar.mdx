# Build for CasparCG

When it's time to use the graphics in CasparCG, open up your terminal and run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will take your graphic(s) and create an optimized bundle of each, and put them into a `/dist` folder in your project's root:

```markdown {6-8}
my-graphics
└── templates
    └── example
        └── index.html
        └── manifest.json
└── dist
    └── example
        └── index.html
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
```

Here all JavaScript and CSS have been inlined into the `/dist/example/index.html` file so that it can be played directly by CasparCG. 
Now all you need to do is move it over to your CasparCG server and play it.

## Build Options

### build.target
Type: `string | string[]`  
Default: `ccg2.3.3`

Compatibility target for the final bundle. The default value is the latest stable CasparCG version, which will be translated into a corresponding Chromium version. 

There's a special value `nxt` available that will bundle the graphics for nxtedition (note that this will override `build.singleFile`). 

Other valid browsers targets (most aren't suitable for CasparCG) can be seen here: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#target.

### build.singleFile
Type: `boolean`  
Default: `true`

If `true` each graphic will produce a single HTML file, with all JavaScript and CSS resources inlined.

### build.include
Type: `string | string[]`

Specify which graphics should be included in the build. If left empty, all graphics will be included.

### build.outDir
Type: `string`  
Default: `dist`

Specify the output directory (relative to project root).
