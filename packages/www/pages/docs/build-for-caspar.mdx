# Build for CasparCG

Open up your terminal and run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will take your graphic(s) and create an optimized bundle of each, and put them into a `/dist` folder in your project's root:

```markdown {6-8}
my-graphics
└── templates
    └── example
        └── index.html
        └── manifest.json
└── dist
    └── example
        └── index.html
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
```

All JavaScript and CSS have been inlined into the `/dist/example/index.html` file so that it can be played directly by CasparCG. 
Now all you need to do is move it over to your CasparCG server and play it.
