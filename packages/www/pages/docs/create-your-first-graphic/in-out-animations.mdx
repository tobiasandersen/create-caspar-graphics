# In/Out Animations

So far we've managed to send dynamic text to our graphic and making sure it fades in/out using
simple CSS transitions. You can get pretty far with this, but at some point you'll most likely 
reach for an animation library to create more complex animations. 

There are a lot of options to choose from, and they all have their pros and cons. We typically reach
for [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for most use cases, but sometimes utilize
  [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for orchestrating animations in a timeline or to animate
  characters, words or lines individually. Here we'll show how you can create the following in/out animation 
  using Framer Motion:

<video src="/in-out-animations.mp4" autoPlay controls loop style={{ margin: '20px 0', borderRadius: 4 }} />

Here's a breakdown of what we're seeing above: 

1. The white box is positioned 20px below the bottom of the screen with an opacity of 0.
2. When it receives `play`, it moves up to its original position during 600 ms, while also fading
in during 400 ms. 
3. After 300 ms, the text 

## Framer Motion

We'll start by converting our div into a [`motion.div`](https://www.framer.com/motion/component/),
and wrapping it inside a FramerMotion component:

```js filename="my-graphics/templates/example/index.jsx" {1, 2, 8, 9, 24, 25}
import { render, useCaspar, FramerMotion } from '@nxtedition/graphics-kit'
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'

function Example() {
  const { data } = useCaspar()

  return (
    <FramerMotion>
      <motion.div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          bottom: 80,
          left: 266,
          width: 1388,
          padding: 20,
          backgroundColor: 'white',
          borderRadius: 6,
          fontSize: 70,
          fontFamily: 'Arial',
          overflow: 'hidden'
        }}
      >
        {data.text}
      </motion.div>
    </FramerMotion>
  )
}

render(Example)
```

This gives our `div` super powers, allowing us to easily add animations to it. `<FramerMotion>` also
takes care of calling `safeToRemove()` once we're done animating. 

Now we can tell it what it should look like **before** it receives `play` using the `initial` prop:

```js
initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 100 }}
```

Next we can tell it what it should look like **after** it receives the `play` command using the `animate` prop:

```js
animate={{
  opacity: 1,
  y: 0,
  transition: {
    opacity: {
      duration: 0.4
    },
    y: {
      duration: 0.6
    }
  }
}}
```

And finally what should happen when it receives `stop` using the `exit` prop:

```js
exit={{
  y: 100,
  opacity: 0,
  transition: {
    duration: 0.4
  }
}}
```

Putting it all together we get this:

```js filename="my-graphics/templates/example/index.jsx" {22-44}
import { render, useCaspar, FramerMotion } from '@nxtedition/graphics-kit'
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'

function Example() {
  const { data } = useCaspar()

  return (
    <FramerMotion>
      <motion.div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          bottom: 80,
          left: 266,
          width: 1388,
          padding: 20,
          backgroundColor: 'white',
          borderRadius: 6,
          fontSize: 70,
          fontFamily: 'Arial',
          overflow: 'hidden'
        }}
        initial={{
          opacity: 0,
          y: 100
        }}
        animate={{
          opacity: 1,
          y: 0,
          transition: {
            opacity: {
              duration: 0.4
            },
            y: {
              duration: 0.6
            }
          }
        }}
        exit={{
          y: 100,
          opacity: 0,
          transition: {
            duration: 0.4
          }
        }}
      >
        {data.text}
      </motion.div>
    </FramerMotion>
  )
}

render(Example)
```

This will animate our white background properly, but if you looked closely at the animation above
you might have noticed that the text has its own animation, with a slight delay. Let's fix that by
wrapping the text in its own `<motion.div>`:


```js filename="my-graphics/templates/example/index.jsx" {46-61}
import { render, useCaspar, FramerMotion } from '@nxtedition/graphics-kit'
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'

function Example() {
  const { data } = useCaspar()

  return (
    <FramerMotion>
      <motion.div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          bottom: 80,
          left: 266,
          width: 1388,
          padding: 20,
          backgroundColor: 'white',
          borderRadius: 6,
          fontSize: 70,
          fontFamily: 'Arial',
          overflow: 'hidden'
        }}
        initial={{
          opacity: 0,
          y: 100
        }}
        animate={{
          opacity: 1,
          y: 0,
          transition: {
            opacity: {
              duration: 0.4
            },
            y: {
              duration: 0.6
            }
          }
        }}
        exit={{
          y: 100,
          opacity: 0,
          transition: {
            duration: 0.4
          }
        }}
      >
        <motion.div
          initial={{
            opacity: 0,
            y: '100%'
          }}
          animate={{
            opacity: 1,
            y: 0,
            transition: {
              duration: 0.3,
              delay: 0.3
            }
          }}
        >
          {data.text}
        </motion.div>
      </motion.div>
    </FramerMotion>
  )
}

render(Example)
```

And we're done! ðŸŽ‰ We now have a graphic that can receive dynamic data and that animates in and out nicely as we send `play` and `stop` commands. 
The only thing left before we can use it in CasparCG is to build it.
