# Sending Data

Our Lowerthird is visible on the screen, but it's just showing the static text "Example":

![Lowerthird](/lowerthird-1.jpg)

## Add a Text Field

Let's make it possible to send any text to it. Open up `manifest.json` once again, but this time add a property called `text` to its schema:

```json filename="my-graphics/templates/example/manifest.json" {4-7}
{
  "name": "Lowerthird",
  "schema": {
    "text": {
      "type": "string",
      "label": "Text"
    }
  },
  "previewData": {}
}
```

You can think of the `schema` as the graphic's blueprint. Here we're saying that our Lowerthird 
accepts one field called `text` of type `string`. 

If you save the file and reload the page, you should see that we now have a new input called "Text" in the sidebar:

![A new input called "Text" has appeared in the Sidebar](/lowerthird-data-text.jpg)

We can now use this field to send text to the graphic. If we type in "Hello World" and press the 
"Update" button, a `JSON` object will be sent to the graphic (you can verify this by opening up the console in Dev Tools):

```json
{
  "text": "Hello World"
}
```

## Make the Graphic Respond to Updates

We've just sent an update to our Lowerthird, but it's still just displaying the text "Example". 
Now we need to tell it to use the `text` field from our update. Open up `index.jsx` and grab 
the `data` object from the `useCaspar()` hook. This object will contain everything we send to it. 
So we can now replace the static text "Example" with the dynamic `data.text` that we just sent to it:

```js filename="my-graphics/templates/example/index.jsx" {1, 4, 20}
import { render, useCaspar } from '@nxtedition/graphics-kit'

function Example() {
  const { data } = useCaspar()

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        bottom: 80,
        left: 266,
        width: 1388,
        padding: 20,
        backgroundColor: 'white',
        borderRadius: 6,
        fontSize: 70,
        fontFamily: 'Arial',
        overflow: 'hidden'
      }}
    >
      {data.text}
    </div>
  )
}

render(Example)
```

And just like that you should now see it display "Hello World" ðŸŽ‰

If you try sending more updates, you'll see that it updates immediately.
