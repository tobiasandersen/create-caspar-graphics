# Introducing State

Currently our graphic is always visible, even though it says `OFF` in the sidebar (which would be the same as it showing before receiving the `play` command from Caspar). 
Let's change that! 

Open up `index.jsx` and grab the `isPlaying` state from the `useCaspar()` hook so that we can hide
the graphic when it's not playing:

```js filename="my-graphics/templates/example/index.jsx" {4, 9-10}
import { render, useCaspar } from '@nxtedition/graphics-kit'

function Example() {
  const { data, isPlaying } = useCaspar()

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        opacity: isPlaying ? 1 : 0,
        transition: 'opacity 1s ease',
        position: 'absolute',
        bottom: 80,
        left: 266,
        width: 1388,
        padding: 20,
        backgroundColor: 'white',
        borderRadius: 6,
        fontSize: 70,
        fontFamily: 'Arial',
        overflow: 'hidden'
      }}
    >
      {data.text}
    </div>
  )
}

render(Example)
```

Now if we make the graphic appear again, by toggling the switch to `ON`, we'll see it fade in over 1
second.

## Safe to Remove

Take the graphic `OFF` again and you'll see that it fades off as expected. But if you try 
toggling it back `ON` you'll  notice that it doesn't work. So what's going on here? 

Typically when taking a graphic off, you want to do so with an animation. And only once that
animation has finished, we want the server to actually remove the graphic. But the server doesn't know how long 
that will take, so instead it will wait for you to tell it that it's safe to remove.

You can do this in two different ways:

1. Call the `safeToRemove()` function when your graphic is ready to be removed.
2. Use the `removeDelay` option to specify how long it should wait before taking the graphic off. 

Since we set our opacity transition to 1s, we'll just set the `removeDelay` to `1`, which will
remove it once second after it recieves `stop`:

```js filename="my-graphics/templates/example/index.jsx" {4}
import { render, useCaspar } from '@nxtedition/graphics-kit'

function Example() {
  const { data, isPlaying } = useCaspar({ removeDelay: 1 })

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        opacity: isPlaying ? 1 : 0,
        transition: 'opacity 1s ease',
        position: 'absolute',
        bottom: 80,
        left: 266,
        width: 1388,
        padding: 20,
        backgroundColor: 'white',
        borderRadius: 6,
        fontSize: 70,
        fontFamily: 'Arial',
        overflow: 'hidden'
      }}
    >
      {data.text}
    </div>
  )
}

render(Example)
```

Now you can toggle the graphic ON/OFF as many times as you want.
