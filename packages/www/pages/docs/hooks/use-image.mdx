# useImage

`useImage` is React hook that pre-loads an image and blocks playing until its decoded and
ready.

```js
const image = useImage({ src })
```

## Reference

Call `useImage` at the top level of your component to get a pre-loaded image source back. If called
before `play`, it will defer playing until the image is ready.

```js
import { useImage } from '@nxtedition/graphics-kit'

function MyGraphic() {
  const image = useImage({ src })
  // ...
}
```

### Parameters
- `src`: The path to the image you want to preload.

### Returns

`useImage` returns null while loading, and when ready it returns an object with:
- `src`: The same path you sent as a parameter. 

## Usage

### Wait for the image to load before showing it

Call `useImage` at the top level of your component to get a pre-loaded path back. 

```js
import { useImage } from '@nxtedition/graphics-kit'

function MyGraphic() {
  const image = useImage({ src: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/13234873/pexels-photo-13234873.jpeg' })

  return (
    <FramerMotion>
      <motion.img src={image?.src} initial={{ scale: 0 }} animate={{ scale: 1 }} />
    </FramerMotion>
  )
}
```
