# useFont

`useFont` is React hook that prevents [FOUT](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/fout) by pre-loading font(s) and blocks playing until its downloaded and ready.

```js
const font = useFont({ src })
```

## Reference

Call `useFont` at the top level of your component to get a pre-loaded font back. If called
before `play`, it will defer playing until the font is ready.

```js
import { useFont } from '@nxtedition/graphics-kit'

function MyGraphic() {
  const font = useFont({ src })
  // ...
}
```

### Parameters
- `src`: The path of the font file as a string or an array of objects (with type `Array<{path: string, weight?: string, style?: string}>`).
- **optional** `weight`: A string that contains the weight of the font. It is equivalent to the font-weight descriptor.
- **optional** `style`: A string that retrieves or sets the style of the font. It is equivalent to the font-style descriptor.

### Returns

`useFont` returns an object with:
- `style`: an object containing `fontFamily` and `visibility`.
